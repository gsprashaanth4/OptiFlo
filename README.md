# OptiFlo
## Simple yet Effective, Optical Flow based Localization using the OV7670 Camera Module and a Teensy 4.0

This Project focuses on Cheap Localization for Small Robotic platforms based on Optical Flow.This project uses the cheap OV7670 VGA camera Module in combination with a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller, to capture subsequent frames and calculate the pixel displacement between them. This is just the basic outline of the sensor package, ofcourse, though not "perfect", it works. This compact, low-cost sensor opens up new possibilities for swarm robotics, indoor drones, and autonomous vehicles without needing GPS or expensive cameras.
